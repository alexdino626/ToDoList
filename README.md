# ToDoList
A simple to-do list
I wanted to get better at organizing my tasks so I made this very simple but easy to use To-Do list for myself for everyday use.
![Todo Default](https://github.com/alexdino626/ToDoList/assets/99157407/d0e26c58-68c7-44c3-8ecc-f9c88775ed08)
![Todo Cross](https://github.com/alexdino626/ToDoList/assets/99157407/7cd12088-ea9f-4482-900c-43d39fc707eb)
You can cross out the tasks you've completed.
I added a button to reset the list and remove the crossed-out tasks.
I also add a text field where you can enter a new task you want to add to the list and press a button to add it.

I use react and npm to do this as well as some MaterialUI.
